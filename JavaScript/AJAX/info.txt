Asynchronous JS and XML
send and receive data asynchronously 
json has replaced xml mostly 
works with plain text too 
reloads only a part from the html without reloading the whole page

how it works: 
1. js call to ajax engine 
2. xmlhttprequest to server
3. server sends json to ajax
4. ajax to browser: html 

XHR Object: 
api in form of an object 
provided by browser js enviroment 
methods to transfer data between client-server
can use with other protocols than http 
can work with other types of data xml, json, plain text

Libraries and other methods: 
jquery - overkill mostly 
axios 
superagent 
fetchAPI - part of the browser 
NodeHTTP
